* [__SN754410NE__](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/SN754410NE/296-9911-5-ND/380180) _(U2)_ - Motor driver, used to control the speed and direction of the two motors.
* [__Teensy 3.2__](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html) _(U1)_- Processor, will run code.
* [__IR Emitters__]() _(D0-D3)_ - Send an IR signal, which will bounce off walls, allowing for the reciever to read. Each is connected to a digital pin on the Teensy, allowing them to individual turn on and off.
* [__IR Reciever__]() _(Q0-Q3)_ - Reads how strong the IR signal is, depending on the value it reads it is able to detect if there is a wall, and how may cells away it is.
* [__Pololu 3081__](https://www.pololu.com/product/3081) _(U5, U4)_ - Motor encoders, used to keep track of wheel rotations.
* [__LM1085 (3A)__](http://www.ti.com/product/LM1085) _(U3)_ - Voltage regulator, a LDO regulator that gives a 5V source from the LiPo. 3A version.
* [__Switch__](http://www.google.com/search?q=mechanical+keyboard+switch) _(SW1)_ - Any mechanical keyboard switch
* [__Buzzer__](https://www.amazon.com/BETAFPV-Terminals-Electronic-Continuous-12X9-5mm/dp/B073RH8TQK) _(BZ1)_ - ~5mm buzzer pin spacing, the small ones in the link fit.
* [__LEDs__](http://www.google.com/search?q=3528+smd+led) _(D4, D5)_ - Any 3528 sized led rated for at least 3.3v
* [__Voltage Regulator (Linear)__](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/LD1085V50/497-3436-5-ND/669220) - Used to step voltage down
* __1.8K立__ _(R1, R2, R3, R4)_ - Current limiting resistors for Receivers.
* __35立__ _(R5, R6, R7, R8)_ - Current limiting resistor for Recievers.

  <br> <li>On the schematic, the IR Emitters are labeled as D0, D1, D2, and D3. Find the corresponding labels on the PCB. They should be at the front of the board</li>
  <li>Place the shorter end of the emitter in the positive throughole of the corresponding pad and the longer end through the negative side. For reference, the D0 pad is shown below.</li>

  <li>After inserting the emitter all the way, bend the emitter's leads so that the emitter lines up parallel to the PCB AND it is centered on the emitter sillhouette on the PCB. You can now solder the emitter. </li>
  <li>Repeat the same process for the IR Receivers. The receivers are located right next to the emitters, and are labelled as Q0, Q1, Q2, and Q3. For the receivers, the short end is also the positive end</li>
  <li>When you're soldering the components, make sure that the LEDs line up with the sillhouettes as much as possible. In other words, the length of the leads above the PCB should be as short as possible. This will ensure that one receiver from one set will not have interference from an emitter of another set. </li>
